Stupid Simple Mobile Safari Slideshow

============================================

My wife needed a slideshow to display on an iPad that simply looped through a list of photos, centered on a black background. She also needed it in the next morning and this is my quick midnight hacking.

This script does the dumbest, laziest thing possible. Instead of listing out each photo's width and height explicitly, I loop through all of them once to figure out their dimensions, saving me a lot of typing (ideally). So when the slideshow is fired up it will flash all the images really quickly and then go into the real slideshow. 

This does use the neat iOS meta tag trick that tells it to hide the browser chrome if you save the page as a bookmark to the home screen.

One note:
I had to put in a cache-buster on the image requests as I don't think the image.onload function fires properly when the images is coming from cache. I didn't really feel like investigating this and busting cache was easy and lazy, keeping in the spirit of the project.
